# Install Groovy Via Maven

Your env: Linux or GitBash on Windows.
Your rationale: you don't have a Goovy installer, but you do have a working Maven environment

Just run the script - optional goovy version as first arg. Script can be run again and again, fairly safely.  

You may or may not need `sudo` for the final placement of the `groovy` command
