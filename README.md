# Install Groovy Via Maven

Your envis bash on Linux or GitBash on Windows.  Mac: not tested.

**Your rationale:** you don't have a Goovy installer, but you do have a working Maven environment

Just run the `install_groovy_via_maven.sh` script in bash - optional goovy version as first arg. Script can be run again and again, fairly safely.  

You may or may not need `sudo` for the final placement of the `groovy` command
